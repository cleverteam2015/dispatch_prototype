        <p id="summary">
          Contractors are required by law to be licensed and regulated by the Contractor's State License Board. Any questions concerning a contractor may be referred to the Registrar, Contractors State License Board, 9835 Goethe Road, Sacramento, CA 95827. Mailing Address: P.O. Box 26000, Sacramento, CA 95826.
          <br><br>
          GUARANTEE ON DETECTIONS: All leak locations and detection work is guaranteed for 30 days from the date of completion. We will re-test the system if it is reported within the above 30 day period that a leak still exists. American Leak Detection will not be liable for any consequential losses  arising from inaccurate location in excess of the fee paid.
          <br><br>
          GUARANTEE ON REPAIRS: Minor repairs made by American Leak Detection are guaranteed for 30 days. Major repairs are guaranteed for 5 years. All repairs are guaranteed from date of completion for defects in workmanship only.
          <br><br>
          NOTE: All repairs made by American Leak Detection include retesting for further leakage at no additional charge. Repairs made by others can be retested upon request. The testing will carry a minimum $150 service charge.
          PIPE CONDITION: If the pipe material is found to be in an advanced state of deterioration when exposed for line repair, this does not represent a breach of contract by American Leak Detection nor does it negate the client’s responsibility to pay for said services. Fees for opening and closing the slab will still be due, even if a re-route is determined to be necessary.
          <br><br>
          I authorize American Leak Detection to complete the above-described work and agree to the charges and terms as described. I further agree to pay reasonable charges for collection, including attorney’s fees, court fees, and collection costs, in the event of my default. Homeowners are responsible for all charges not covered by Insurance company. 
          Interest will be charged at a rate of 1.5% per month on accounts over 30 days. We accept all major credit cards. Please write invoice number on check.
